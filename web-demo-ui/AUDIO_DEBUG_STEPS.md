# 🔍 Audio Debug Steps

## Current Status:
- ✅ PlainTransport connects successfully
- ✅ Consumer created and resumed  
- ✅ FFmpeg starts and recognizes Opus audio
- ❌ Only getting WAV header (94-102 bytes) - no actual audio data
- ❌ FFmpeg exits with "Unknown error" immediately

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis:

The issue is that **FFmpeg isn't receiving RTP packets** from MediaSoup. This could be:

### 1. **No Audio Input**
- Are you actually **speaking into the microphone**?
- Is the microphone working in the browser?
- Check browser dev tools for microphone access

### 2. **Producer Not Streaming**  
- The original producer might not be sending audio
- MediaSoup consumer might not be forwarding packets

### 3. **Port/Network Issues**
- RTP packets not reaching FFmpeg on the expected port
- Firewall blocking UDP traffic

## 🧪 Debug Tests:

### **Test 1: Verify Microphone Input**
1. Open browser dev tools → Console
2. Start streaming 
3. **Speak loudly into microphone**
4. Check for audio level indicators in the UI
5. Look for MediaSoup logs about audio packets

### **Test 2: Network Packet Monitoring**
```bash
# Run this in a separate terminal:
node debug_rtp_flow.js

# Then start streaming and speak into microphone
# Look for RTP packet logs
```

### **Test 3: Check Consumer Stats** 
Add this to the FFmpeg setup after consumer creation:
```javascript
setInterval(() => {
  consumer.getStats().then(stats => {
    console.log('📊 Consumer stats:', {
      bytesReceived: stats.bytesReceived,
      packetsReceived: stats.packetsReceived,
      packetsLost: stats.packetsLost
    });
  });
}, 2000);
```

## 🎯 Most Likely Issue:

Based on the logs, I suspect **no RTP packets are being generated** because:
1. Either the microphone isn't capturing audio
2. Or the MediaSoup producer isn't actually streaming

## 🚀 Next Steps:

1. **Restart MediaSoup server**
2. **Start streaming** 
3. **SPEAK LOUDLY INTO MICROPHONE** (this is critical!)
4. Look for logs showing RTP packet activity
5. If still no packets, the issue is in the producer/consumer setup, not FFmpeg

The 94-102 bytes are just the WAV file header - FFmpeg creates the header immediately but never receives audio data to fill it.
